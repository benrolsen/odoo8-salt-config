This repo contains Salt Masterless files to quickly set up an Odoo 8.0 environment.
Only CentOS 7 is supported.

First install the EPEL and do a system update:
yum install -y epel-release
PostgreSQL 9.3 has enough improvements that it's worth getting. This adds the official repo:
rpm -iUvh http://yum.postgresql.org/9.3/redhat/rhel-7-x86_64/pgdg-centos93-9.3-1.noarch.rpm

Install the Odoo Redhat repo:
yum-config-manager --add-repo=https://nightly.odoo.com/8.0/nightly/rpm/odoo.repo

And update:
yum update

To get started on a new VM, first install git and salt-minion:
yum install -y git salt-minion

Download this repo to /srv/salt on the VM:
mkdir -p /srv/salt; cd /srv/salt
git clone https://github.com/benrolsen/odoo8-salt-config.git .

Copy the minion conf file to the appropriate place:
mkdir -p /etc/salt/minion.d
cp minion-conf /etc/salt/minion.d/odoo-minion.conf

Tell Salt to run all configurations:
salt-call -l warning state.highstate > /tmp/hightstate.log


*** On the web server ***
May need to do this to fix nginx:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13895933/nginx-getting-error-with-specific-domain-name

Install the Odoo RPM:
yum install odoo

Start the Odoo server on CentOS 7:
systemctl start odoo-server


To update the odoo code, yum upgrade:
yum update odoo

And then change to the odoo user for the custom addons:
su - odoo
cd /home/odoo/openerp-custom-addons
git pull

You'll need to stop the odoo-server service and manually reload all the DB data from files:
(as root) systemctl stop odoo-server
(as odoo) openerp-server -d <dbname> -u all -c /etc/odoo/odoo-server-single.conf --stop-after-init
openerp-server -d test1 -u imsar_auth_ldap -c /etc/odoo/odoo-server-single.conf
openerp-server -c /etc/odoo/odoo-server-single.conf
Make sure to load a page so the reload happens, and then kill the manual process:
(as root) systemctl start odoo-server
